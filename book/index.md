Do you wonder how Jetpack Compose works internally, or how the compiler or the runtime work together? Are you curious about other use cases for Compose? Did you ever think about how Composable functions communicate with the compiler and the runtime?

It's your lucky day 🙌 **Jetpack Compose internals** is your chance to go one step further and learn the guts of what will become the new standard of Android UI.

### The content

> This book is currently in the works 🚧 and will be pre-launched very soon. The book will cover the following topics among many others.

* Composable functions in depth. What they represent and their properties.
* Annotations provided by the Compose runtime and their detailed purpose.
* Static analysis performed by the Compose compiler. Frontend compiler checks in place to help while we write code.
* Compiler IR code generation.
* Runtime optimizations and how they are unlocked by the Compose compiler.
* Architecture of the Compose compiler.
* Architecture of the Compose runtime.
* The slot table and the list of changes. The in-memory representation of the Composable call graph. How and when the runtime stores the relevant data from the Composition.
* Composition and Recomposition. How the Composition is created and how it is updated via Recomposition.
* Recomposition scopes.
* How the runtime materializes the node tree via the Applier.
* Compose UI. How the code we write communicates with the compiler and the runtime. Emitting nodes into the Composition. Adding, moving, replacing, and deleting nodes from the tree.
* The State snapshot system, change propagation and smart recomposition.
* Effects and effect handlers. How they are stored in-memory and when they are triggered. Their lifecycle.
* The Composable lifecycle. How it relates to the Android components lifecycle.
* Advanced Compose use cases. Generic node types. Examples of diverse use cases for the Compose compiler and the runtime.
* Multiplatform support.
* Much more 🚀

### The authors and the project

This book is being written by me ([Jorge Castillo](https://www.twitter.com/JorgeCastilloPR)) and [Andrei Shikov](https://twitter.com/shikasd_).

I started writing this book around a year ago, and it helped me to escape a bit from the events happening around and focus on something interesting. It started as a series of posts and suddenly became a book. It is a chance to challenge myself and learn more about a new technology. A great consequence is to be able to share all the gathered knowledge with others 🥳

To write this book we explored the Jetpack Compose sources via [cs.android.com](https://cs.android.com) and sources included in Android Studio. We also had to built our own side projects.

This book aims to gather all the relevant knowledge about Jetpack Compose internals so it works as a reference for the years to come. Jetpack Compose is the future of Android UI, but it will also gain relevance in other platforms given its multiplatform nature.
