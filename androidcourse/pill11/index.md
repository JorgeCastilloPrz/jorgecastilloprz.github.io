Layouts are how we represent UI in Android. They are coded with `XML`. Our first layout will be a blank screen for now. To do that, we need to add a `resource`.

Resources are a big thing in Android. Any strings, layouts (UI), dimensions, styles, drawables and much more are stored as resources so we can reference them by code. We'll learn about them gradually.

The initial resource type we need to add is a `layout`, so go ahead and add a `layout` resurce folder to the already existing `res` directory.

`right click over res` -> `New` -> `Android Resource Directory`. Then we need to pick `layout` in the dropdown, and forget about the qualifiers box.

Once we have the `layout` folder: `right click on it` -> `New` -> `Layout resource file` to add our Layout. Name it `activity_main` and write `LinearLayout` below. We'll use that component as the parent. We'll understand in a second.
