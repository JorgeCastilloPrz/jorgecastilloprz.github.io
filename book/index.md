    <p style="margin-top:25px;">Do you wonder how Jetpack Compose works internally, or how the compiler or the runtime work together? Are you curious about other use cases for Compose? Did you ever think about how Composable functions communicate with the compiler and the runtime?</p>

    <p>It's your lucky day üôå <b>Jetpack Compose internals</b> is your chance to go one step further and learn the guts of what will become the new standard of Android UI.</p>

### <span style="font-family: 'Quicksand', 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The authors and the project</span>

This book is being written by me ([Jorge Castillo](https://www.twitter.com/JorgeCastilloPR)) and [Andrei Shikov](https://twitter.com/shikasd_).

I started writing this book around a year ago, and it helped me to escape a bit from the events happening around and focus on something interesting. It started as a series of posts and suddenly became a book. It is a chance to challenge myself and learn more about a new technology. A great consequence is to be able to share all the gathered knowledge with others ü•≥

To write this book we explored the Jetpack Compose sources via [cs.android.com](https://cs.android.com) and sources included in Android Studio. We also had to built our own side projects.

This book aims to gather all the relevant knowledge about Jetpack Compose internals so it works as a reference for the years to come. Jetpack Compose is the future of Android UI, but it will also gain relevance in other platforms given its multiplatform nature.
