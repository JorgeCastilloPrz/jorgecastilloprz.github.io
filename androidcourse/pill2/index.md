We already got Android Studio installed. Time to create our first Android project! üôå

Let's pick the option to "Create New Project" to create a brand new one üôè

Then select "Basic Activity" from the Phone and Tablet tab, as the template to use.

We will use this template as a starting point since it provides the basic stuff needed to get a simple screen up and running out of the box, so we can start building our app on top of it üëç

We will get back to it in detail, but for now you can think of an "Activity" as a screen within our app.

Click on "Next" and you will get a form for some **initial project configuration**.

Here you will need to enter the following details:

* **Name:** The name for the project. The app name displayed on the device after installing is defaulted to this one, but can be changed independently.
* **Package name:** Highly important. It will identify our app once uploaded to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps) (the app store). It's a good practice to use a reversed domain name for it, even if not required. In my case I own [jorgecastillo.dev](https://jorgecastillo.dev), so `dev.jorgecastillo` followed by the app name seems fine.
* **Save location:** The directory to save the project while we work on it.
* **Language:** Let's pick Kotlin since it's the [official programming language for Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
* **Minimum SDK:** The minimum version of the Android OS you wan to support. The lower it is, the more Android devices your app will be able to be installed on. We will get back to this one in a second.
* **Use legacy android.support libraries:** Keep this one unchecked since that's not recommended anymore.

### Minimum SDK

Just a small disclaimer üö®

If you look again to the image above, you'll notice that the wizard already gives us some info about the percentage of devices that will support our app depending on the Minimum SDK we choose.

The minimum allowed here is Android 4.1, which is **super old**. If we picked that one, we'd support a 99.8% of the devices out there, so it would seem like a great pick at a first glance.

The issue with this is that by picking a too old min SDK, we would require lots of conditional logics in our code to make it both retrocompatible and still support the newer nicer features only available on newer versions of the SDK. Per my experience, this can become quite counter productive.

I totally recommend **finding a good compromise between the amount of devices supported and the code quality and maintenance**.

Android 5.0 (Lollipop) is the recommended pick nowadays, since more than a 94% of devices are supported, which gives a very good range, and APIs started getting much better on that version.

The Android Studio wizard also provides more detailed information about the distribution charts per Android versions. Click on "Help me choose" right below the picker, and you'll see this awesome diagram:

Once you click "Finish" you will be ready to start coding your initial Android app üéâ
