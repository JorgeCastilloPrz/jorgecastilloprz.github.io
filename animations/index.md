You can take it either if you are starting with Jetpack Compose or you want to master it. You don't need to be an expert on Android UI to take it.

## <span class="course-content-h2" style="font-family: 'Quicksand', 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The stages</span>

The course consists of 8 stages of 1 week duration. They include one or two recordings and a batch of exercises related to the topic. You join other attendees to go through each one. Enjoy the watch parties and discuss any doubts and details in our Discord community. More details on each stage to be published.

## <span class="course-content-h2" style="font-family: 'Quicksand', 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">The ultimate goal</span>

This course takes you further and deeper into Compose animations than any other existing course out there. It has been consciously crafted to work gradually and over real apps, and learn how to implement lots of animations and transitions during the process.

## <span class="course-content-h2" style="font-family: 'Quicksand', 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;">Why to take it?</span>

Material guidelines are great, but animations and transitions from the official Material Design docs are not easy to replicate. At the same time, adding some smooth, little fancy animations make a huge difference for the end user. This course is the best chance you have to improve the UX of your apps quickly and become an expert in this field. Companies around will definitely appreciate having an engineer with this level of UI knowledge.
