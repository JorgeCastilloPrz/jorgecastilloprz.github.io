Don't you wonder how Jetpack Compose works internally? How the compiler or the runtime work together? Are you curious about other use cases for Compose? Did you ever think about how Composable functions communicate with the compiler and the runtime?

You are lucky today ðŸ™Œ **Jetpack Compose internals** is your chance to go one step further and learn the guts of what will become the new standard of Android UI.

### The content

This book is currently under works ðŸš§ and will be pre-launched very soon. The book will cover the following topics among many others:

* Composable functions in depth. What they represent and their properties.
* Annotations provided by the Compose runtime and their detailed purpose.
* Static analysis performed by the Compose compiler. Frontend compiler checks in place to help while we write code.
* Compiler IR code generation to enable runtime optimizations and features.
* Architecture of the Compose compiler.
* Architecture of the Compose runtime.
* The slot table. The in-memory representation of the Composable call graph. How and when the runtime stores the relevant data from the Composition.
* Composition and Recomposition. How the Composition is created and how it is updated via Recomposition.
* Recomposition scopes.
* How the runtime materializes the node tree via the Applier.
* Compose UI. How the code we write communicates with the compiler and the runtime. Emitting nodes into the Composition. Adding, moving, replacing, and deleting nodes from the tree.
* The State snapshot system.
* Effects and effect handlers. How they are stored in-memory and when they are triggered. Their lifecycle.
* The Composable lifecycle. How it relates to the Android components lifecycle.
* Advanced Compose use cases. Generic node types. Examples of diverse use cases for the Compose compiler and the runtime.
* Multiplatform support.
* Much more ðŸš€

### The authors and the project

This book is being written by me ([Jorge Castillo](https://www.twitter.com/JorgeCastilloPR)) and [Andrei Shikov](https://twitter.com/shikasd_).

I started this project more than a year ago, when the pandemics started. I did it as a means to escape a bit from what was happening around and focus on something that seemed very interesting at a first glance. It started as a series of posts and suddenly became a book due to its length. This project was also a chance to challenge myself and learn more about a new technology. A great consequence is to be able to share all the gathered knowledge with others ðŸ¥³

To write this book we had to dig into the Jetpack Compose sources via [cs.android.com](https://cs.android.com) and the sources included in Android Studio, and explore the guts of the Compose architecture building our own side projects.

This book aims to gather all the relevant knowledge about Jetpack Compose internals so it works as a reference for the years to come. Jetpack Compose is the future of Android UI, but it will also gain relevance in other platforms given its multiplatform nature.

### How to acquire the book

This book is currently under works ðŸš§ and will be pre-launched very soon. You can register here to get a notification once it is released. Stay tuned!
