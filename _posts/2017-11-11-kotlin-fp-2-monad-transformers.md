Step inside to understand how to collapse monad stacks into unified types to reduce nesting ðŸ‘Œ

If you havenâ€™t read [the first part on this series](https://jorgecastillo.dev/kotlin-fp-1-monad-stack), please do it before reading this. It will help you to understand. Also, this post is a further iteration on that approach.

---

### The problem

Something very well said on the FP world is that **monads do not compose**. At least not gracefully. They just compose when you return the same monad on all the functions on a call chain, so you can use `flatMap` or `flatten` to collapse the stack. But thatâ€™s a very unlikely situation.

In a standard scenario you have different concerns at different levels in your architecture, so your functions will most likely return different monads for those levels. That means your stack will end up being deeply nested.

When you get many nested levels on the stack, it starts looking like a pyramid where you need to `flatMap` and `map` all the way down the type stack to reach the innermost value. Let's have a look to one of the snippets in the [Monad Stack post](https://jorgecastillo.dev/kotlin-fp-1-monad-stack).

```kotlin
fun getHeroesUseCase(): Reader<DependencyGraph, IO<Either<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>>> =
    getAllHeroesDataSource().map { io ->
        io.map { maybeHeroes ->
            maybeHeroes.flatMap { heroes ->
                Right(heroes.filter { it.thumbnail.isEmpty() })
            }
        }
    }
```

We need to `map` over the `Reader` returned by the `DataSource` to get access to the inner `IO<Either<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>>`, then we need to map over the `IO` again to reach the `Either`, and finally we can `flatMap` over it to get access to the inner list of heroes.

This happens because we got different concerns encoded here: dependency injection (`Reader`), pure deferred computations (`IO`), and typed error handling (`Either`).

Nesting affects readability, and this approach can exponentially lead to scary scenarios.

### Monad comprehensions

When you're lucky enough to be playing with a single monad in all your composed computations, you can get a huge readability boost by using the **Monad Comprehensions**, or what in other languages is called **Do Notation**.

Let's take a look at this snippet:

```kotlin
data class Country(val id: String, val name: String, val countryCode: String)
data class Address(val id: String, val street: String, val countryId: String)
data class Person(val id: String, val name: String, val addressId: String)

fun loadPerson(id: String): IO<Person> = TODO("IO computation!")
fun loadAddress(id: String): IO<Address> = TODO("IO computation!")
fun loadCountry(id: String): IO<Country> = TODO("IO computation!")

fun getCountryCode(personId: String): IO<String> =
    loadPerson(personId).flatMap { person ->
        loadAddress(person.addressId).flatMap { address ->
            loadCountry(address.countryId).map { country ->
                country.countryCode
            }
        }
    }
```

Here we have 3 `IO` computations to perform. Each one depends on the result of the previous one, so they're sequential. That means we must use `flatMap` (Monad). The only problem is how fast indentation levels grow. We can use monad comprehensions to sugarize that with a nice direct syntax. [ArrowFx provides a simple approach to monad comprehensions](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/effects/fx/).

```kotlin
fun getCountryCode(personId: String): IO<String> = fx {
    val person = loadPerson(personId).bind()
    val address = loadAddress(person.addressId).bind()
    val country = loadCountry(address.countryId).bind()
    country.countryCode
}
```

Here we go, we got our nesting resolved gracefully ðŸŽ‰. `bind()` essentially allows to `flatMap` under the hood and extract the inner value so it's assigned to the left hand side, hence can be used as a requirement for the next line.

Now we can read our asynchronous code as if it was synchronous with this powerful feature from [ArrowFx](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/effects/fx/). I'll write more about it in further posts, so stay tuned!

But remember: we can do this here mainly because we are just playing with a single monad here for all our computations: `IO`. What happens when we have different nested types as in the first example?

### Real world problem

If we get back to the initial snippet:

```kotlin
fun getHeroesUseCase(): Reader<DependencyGraph, IO<Either<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>>> =
    getAllHeroesDataSource().map { io ->
        io.map { maybeHeroes ->
            maybeHeroes.flatMap { heroes ->
                Right(heroes.filter { it.thumbnail.isEmpty() })
            }
        }
    }
```

Our return type here was highly nested:

```kotlin
Reader<DependencyGraph, IO<Either<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>>
```

So there we had our composed `Reader` computation expecting a context providing the required dependencies to run. When dependencies were provided, unsafe effects wrapped on `IO` could be run, which would return either an error or a valid list of heroes.

The stack was starting to get a bit complex, therefore **readability decreased**.

But the monad stack approach is actually incomplete. Functional developers wouldnâ€™t stay there but iterate further. They'd probably use **Monad Transformers** to solve this problem.

### Whatâ€™s a Monad Transformer?

Itâ€™s similar to a regular monad, but itâ€™s not a standalone entity: instead, it modifies the behaviour of an underlying monad.

Most of the monads provided by [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) have transformer equivalents.

By convention, the transformer version of a monad has the same name followed by a `T` . For example, the transformer equivalent of `State` is `StateT`.

When you need an already existing monad like `IO<A>` to obtain the capabilities of a different monad like `Either<A, B>`, you use a transformer.

### How do we benefit from it?

By using transformers you **remove nesting by collapsing all your return types into a single one** that has the same capabilities than all the previous ones by itself.

That means you get rid of the complexity provoked by nested monads, where you are forced to `map` / `flatMap` over each level to gain access to the next one in the stack. Since you got all capabilities under the same collapsed type, now **you just need to `map` or `flatMap` once** to access the inner value. That's all.

Your code becomes simpler thanks to Transformers.

### Fixing the stack

Letâ€™s pick the deepest nested types, which would be the following:

```kotlin
IO<Either<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>>
```

We have an `IO` computation wrapping a side effect and making it pure.  Inside of it, we got an `Either` data type, since we want to create a duality in the return type that `IO` is not supporting by itself. (`IO` just provides built in support for handling `Throwable` errors, but we need them strongly typed for our architecture).

To avoid the nesting here, we could gift `IO` with the code branching powers of `Either` using the **Either Transformer**.

Its type is: `EitherT<F, A, B>`, where `F` is the underlying monad type (will be `IO`), `A` is the left type for the `Either` and `B` is gonna be the result type.

For our super heroes example the types would be:

```kotlin
EitherT<ForIO, CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>
```

`ForIO` is just the way we use to refer to IO on a generic type slot. So IO is here the underlying monad. That's part of the boilerplate we automatically generate to emulate higher kinded types in Arrow.

Thanks to `EitherT`, `IO` is now capable of retaining typed errors (not just throwables) ðŸŽ‰.

We could create an alias for it for seamless usage.

```kotlin
typealias EitherIO<A, B> = EitherT<ForIO, A, B>
```

But the stack is still a bit bigger:

```kotlin
Reader<GetHeroesContext, EitherIO<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>>
```

Since we'll have an outer `Reader` that will set the type for `A` (`List<SuperHero>`), we'll need to use what we call a *partially applied type* for the inner `EitherT`.

```kotlin
typealias EitherIO<E> = EitherTPartialOf<ForIO, E>
```

By using `EitherTPartialOf` we're partially applying some of the `EitherT` generic types (`F` and `E`). That means we'll be fixing both `F` and `E` types when this `EitherIO<E>` gets resolved. We'll be passing `IO` and `CharacterError` to those.

That means we are just leaving the door open for `A` as a still not applied type, so the `Reader` can set it.

On top of this, **we need to gift the powers of `Reader` to the already overpowered `IO`**, so it can also provide dependency injection and not just `IO` deferred computations and typed error handling, which is what we have for the time being.

We can use the **Reader Transformer** to achieve that: `ReaderT<F, D, A>`.

`F` is going to be our brand new `EitherIO` now, `D` will be the `Reader` context containing the program dependencies, and `A` will be the final result type.

```kotlin
typealias RIO<E, B> = ReaderT<EitherIO<E>, DependencyGraph, B>
```

That's the final type we'll use along our complete architecture. It encodes dependency injection (`Reader`), typed error handling (`Either`), and pure deferred execution (`IO`).

Even if it can still look like nested types, it is indeed a single one with all the required capabilities.

Here's how the initial algorithm could look like now:

```kotlin
fun getHeroesUseCaseT(): RIO<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>> =
    getAllHeroesDataSourceT().flatMap(RIOApi.monadError()) { heroes ->
        RIOApi.just(heroes.filter { it.thumbnail.isEmpty() })
    }
```

We'd not need to map twice of three times anymore to reach the inner value, but just a single time. Transformers need some dependencies that need to be provided like in this case the monad. You can build those instances statically as I did here, at least [until we provide proper support for typeclasses compile time resolution](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pull/87). If we get that we'll be able get those automatically injected for you.

> Little gotcha: `ReaderT` is also called **`Kleisli`**. Itâ€™s indeed a type alias in Arrow.

```kotlin
typealias ReaderT<F, D, A>  = Kleisli<F, D, A>
```

Kleisli is the abstraction for a computation that requires some dependencies to run and that can run over any context `F` (which could be `IO`, `Observable`, `Flowable`, `Deferred`, `Flux`... etc).

### Complete architecture using RIO

Let's prepare some utilities that will come handy for shortcutting some common behaviors and type inference that we'll reuse from different places.

```kotlin
object RIOApi {
	fun monadError() = EitherT.monadError<ForIO, CharacterError>(IO.monad())

   fun <E> raiseError(e: E): RIO<E, Nothing> =
        RIO.raiseError(EitherT.monadError<ForIO, E>(IO.monad()), e)

   fun <A> just(a: A): RIO<Nothing, A> =
        RIO.just(EitherT.applicative<ForIO, Nothing>(IO.applicative()), a)

   fun ask() = ReaderT.ask<EitherTPartialOf<ForIO, CharacterError>, DependencyGraph>(monadError())
}
```

Our program has a dependency on an `EitherTMonadError` to be able to handle errors, map and flatMap, so I'm shortcutting access to it here.

I'm also providing sugar methods for lifting errors or successful values into our `RIO` type.

Finally, there's an `ask()` method to build up a `ReaderT` from a given dependency context, so we can implicitly get access to it [as we explained in the previous post in the series](https://jorgecastillo.dev/kotlin-fp-1-monad-stack).

Let's implement our architecture now. We'll start in our data layer, where we want to fetch a bunch of heroes from network or return a typed error otherwise.

```kotlin
fun getAllHeroesDataSourceT(): RIO<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>> {
    return RIOApi.ask().flatMap(RIOApi.monadError()) { ctx ->
        val response = ctx.service.getCharacters()
        if (response.isSuccessful) {
            val networkHeroes = ctx.gson.deserializeHeroes(response.body)
            RIOApi.just(networkHeroes.toDomain())
        } else {
            when (response.code) {
                401 -> RIOApi.raiseError(CharacterError.AuthenticationError)
                404 -> RIOApi.raiseError(CharacterError.NotFoundError)
                else -> RIOApi.raiseError(CharacterError.UnknownServerError)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As we did in previous article, we `ask()` for a reader to be able to reach the context (`ctx`) implicitly without the need to pass it as function arguments. Remember `Reader` is able to implicitly pass program dependencies all the way down the call stack so we don't need to manually pass them anymore.

Then we fetch heroes and lift valid results or errors into `RIO` depending on the case. That's all.

Moving on to the use case now:

```kotlin
fun getHeroesUseCaseT(): RIO<CharacterError, List<SuperHero>> =
    getAllHeroesDataSourceT().flatMap(RIOApi.monadError()) { heroes ->
        RIOApi.just(heroes.filter { it.thumbnail.isEmpty() })
    }
```

Simple enough. We can flatMap over the result of the `DataSource`, apply our business logic which is just filtering some heroes in this case, then lift those again into `RIO`. `flatMap` requires passing a `Monad` in `Kleisli`, since it needs to know how to transform the inner value that is from a type `F`. Here we're reusing the `MonadError` instance we got which is a bit more specific so it'll suffice. `MonadError` is a `Monad` that is also able to handle errors.

Our presentation logic could look like this:

```kotlin
fun getSuperHeroesT(): RIO<CharacterError, Unit> {
    return RIOApi.ask().flatMap(RIOApi.monadError()) { ctx ->
        getHeroesUseCaseT().map(RIOApi.monadError()) { heroes ->
            drawHeroes(heroes, ctx.view)
        }.handleError(RIOApi.monadError()) { error ->
            drawError(error, ctx.view)
        }
    }
}
```

Again, we `ask()` for a `Reader` to get access to its context by `flatMapping` it. We use the context to access the `View` dependency. We fetch heroes and apply effects depending on the case.

Note that the computation is still deferred, we're just building our algebras here. We build a declarative stack of computations that we'll decide to run at some point, but not yet.

Finally, the view implementation would be the *edge of the world* here. It will enforce the deferred stack to resolve and perform the unsafe effects, like:

```kotlin
fun onResume() {
   val dependencies = DependencyGraph(this, HeroesService(), Gson())
   val algebra = getSuperHeroesT().run(dependencies)
   algebra.value().fix().unsafeRunAsync {}
}
```

So we got our **concern separation** very clear here. We have an **algebra** that is deferred and waiting to be run whenever our dependencies are ready. In the other hand we got the **runtime** which will stand for:

```kotlin
algebra.value().fix().unsafeRunAsync {}
```

That's the moment we're running the whole call stack and performing the effects.


### What about testing?

Testing becomes trivial when you have a reader in place. In our case a reader transformer. You just need to provide a different context implementation that can be providing mocks for the required dependencies.

So you can keep exercising the real production code base and just pass a different context to assert over the whole system execution.

As you've notice I'm not using almost any classes here for the program logics, mostly just for the data. My functions are pure and compose the complete architecture. That means you can test the whole system end to end without the need for much mocking, since all the functions are pure and don't contain any unsafe side effects. The only effects available would be the things you'd want to provide from your `Reader` context, so you have the power to provide different implementations for those at testing time.
