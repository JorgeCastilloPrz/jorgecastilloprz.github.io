We already got Android Studio installed. Time to create our first Android project! üôå

Most of us love pets so we are building a pet adoption app üê∂ Let's pick the option to "Create New Project".

<img src="../../assets/images/android studio main menu.png" alt="Android Studio" style="width:600px;">

Then select "No Activity" from the Phone and Tablet tab, as the template to use.

<img src="../../assets/images/android studio create project 1.png" alt="Android Studio" style="width:600px;">

We will use this template as a starting point since it provides an empty application structure, so we can start adding our screens on top of it üëç

We will get back to it in detail, but for now we can think of an "Activity" as a screen within our app.

Click on "Next" and we will get a form for some **initial project configuration**.

What we have here:

* **Name:** For the project. The app name displayed on the device (after installing) is defaulted to this one, but can be changed independently.
* **Package name:** Highly important. It identifies our app once uploaded to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps) (the app store). It's a good practice to use a reversed domain name for it, even if not required. In my case I own [jorgecastillo.dev](https://jorgecastillo.dev), so `dev.jorgecastillo` followed by the app name seems fine.
* **Save location:** The directory to save the project while we work on it.
* **Language:** Kotlin, since it's the [official programming language for Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
* **Minimum SDK:** The minimum version of the Android OS to support. The lower it is, the more Android devices will be able to install it. We will get back to this in a second.
* **Use legacy android.support libraries:** Keep this one unchecked since that's not recommended anymore.

Don't click "Finish" for now. We'll learn one more thing in the next pill and we'll be ready to start üôå
