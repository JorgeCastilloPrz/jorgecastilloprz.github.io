Short overview of the sealed interfaces coming up in Kotlin 1.5.

### üö® Disclaimer

Sealed interfaces are **Experimental**. They may be dropped or changed at any time. You can give feedback on them [in YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42433?_ga=2.63257064.633709735.1615016427-1586827560.1591541237).

### üîé Subclass location

Limitations on where to write the subclasses of a sealed class are a matter of compiler awareness. It needs to know about all the subclasses available in order to ensure exhaustiveness.

> Until not long ago, the compiler was not capable of looking further than the scope of the sealed class itself, so it was forbidden to declare subclasses outside of it. Kotlin 1.1 made it possible to declare those within the same file.

Starting on Kotlin 1.5 location restrictions will get relaxed, so we can declare them on different files **under the same module**. This restricts it to only implementations that "you own". The Kotlin compiler can still ensure exhaustiveness given that the module is compiled together. This is also possible for [sealed classes and sealed interfaces in Java 15](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360).

The aim is also to allow splitting large sealed class hierarchies into different files to make things more readable.

This ability to split declarations will also go for sealed interfaces.

```kotlin
// Vehicle.kt
sealed interface Vehicle

// Cars.kt
object FuelCar : Vehicle
object ElectricCar : Vehicle

// Trains.kt
object HighSpeedRail : Vehicle
object MonoRail : Vehicle
object Tram : Vehicle
object InterCity : Vehicle

// Plane.kt
object Airliner : Vehicle
object Ultralight : Vehicle
```

Note that this change is also experimental. You can give feedback [here](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-42433?_ga=2.134533430.633709735.1615016427-1586827560.1591541237).

### ü§î Why not sealed class?

When we limit the implementations per module, our library can have public sealed interfaces as part of its API surface, therefore hiding the internal implementations of it and ensuring they'll not get extra implementations provided by the client. That is very welcome for library makers ‚úÖ

That way both library devs and clients can leverage exhaustive evaluation over a contract represented by an interface without leaking any internal implementations.

But truth is you could achieve the same with a sealed class, given they share the same limitation. So why to seal interfaces?

If we use `interfaces` across the board and there comes the need to limit the possible implementations of it, `sealed class` is not a valid replacement for all the cases.

One example of this would be enum classes that implement interfaces. [In Kotlin that is possible](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/enum-classes.html#implementing-interfaces-in-enum-classes). Given enums can't subclass other classes, a sealed class would not work.

It's also important to note that interfaces can implement multiple other interfaces, and sealed classes are limited to a single parent class, so there would be cases we cannot cover.

One interesting door we are opening with `sealed interface` is the fact that we can make a subclass be part of multiple sealed hierarchies.

Think of the following set of domain errors modeled with standard `sealed classes`:

```kotlin
  sealed class CommonErrors // to reuse across hierarchies
  object ServerError : CommonErrors()
  object Forbidden : CommonErrors()
  object Unauthorized : CommonErrors()

  sealed class LoginErrors {
    data class InvalidUsername(val username: String) : LoginErrors()
    object InvalidPasswordFormat : LoginErrors()
    data class CommonError(val error: CommonErrors) : LoginErrors()
  }

  sealed class GetUserErrors {
    data class UserNotFound(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors()
    data class InvalidUserId(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors()
    data class CommonError(val error: CommonErrors) : GetUserErrors()
  }
```

Let's imagine a couple of network requests to perform a login and to load the user details. Each request can produce some errors specific to its domain, but it could also yield one of the `CommonErrors` that are generic. With sealed classes, reusing those hierarchies becomes a bit dirty, since it requires adding an extra wrapper case to each hierarchy where we want to reuse it, as you can see above.

That creates a smell while processing it, since we are required to use nested `when` statements:

```kotlin
fun handleError(loginError: LoginErrors): String = when (loginError) {
  is LoginErrors.InvalidUsername -> TODO()
  LoginErrors.InvalidPasswordFormat -> TODO()
  is LoginErrors.CommonError -> when (loginError.error) {
    Forbidden -> TODO()
    ServerError -> TODO()
    Unauthorized -> TODO()
  }
}
```

This is far from ideal given we need to perform both checks for the outer and inner sealed classes separately.

One thing we could try is extending one sealed class with another. In Kotlin extending a sealed class with another means extending the cases of the parent with the additional ones provided by the child. Something like this:

```kotlin
sealed class CommonErrors : LoginErrors() // We add the common errors to the LoginError hierarchy.
object ServerError : CommonErrors()
object Forbidden : CommonErrors()
object Unauthorized : CommonErrors()

sealed class LoginErrors {
  data class InvalidUsername(val username: String) : LoginErrors()
  object InvalidPasswordFormat : LoginErrors()
}
```

This has the effect we want. It effectively makes `LoginError` exhaustive about all the cases including the ones provided by `CommonError`:

```kotlin
fun handleLoginError(error: LoginErrors): String = when (error) {
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
  is LoginErrors.InvalidUsername -> TODO()
  LoginErrors.InvalidPasswordFormat -> TODO()
}

fun handleCommonError(error: CommonErrors): String = when (error) {
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
}
```

Note how `CommonErrors` stays as is.

The issue with this approach is that given we want to make `CommonErrors` cases part of the other two hirarchies, we'd need to extend to superclasses which is not possible in Kotlin: `sealed class CommonErrors : LoginErrors(), GetUserErrors()`.

So, we're left with the wrapping approach only. Ideally we would want to flatten it by making the `CommonErrors` simply be part of both `GetUserErrors` and `LoginErrors` hierarchies somehow. Sealed interfaces will unlock this:

```kotlin
sealed class CommonErrors : LoginErrors, GetUserErrors // extend both hierarchies üëç
object ServerError : CommonErrors()
object Forbidden : CommonErrors()
object Unauthorized : CommonErrors()

sealed interface LoginErrors {
  data class InvalidUsername(val username: String) : LoginErrors
  object InvalidPasswordFormat : LoginErrors
}

sealed interface GetUserErrors {
  data class UserNotFound(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors
  data class InvalidUserId(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors
}

fun handleLoginError(error: LoginErrors): String = when (error) {
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
  LoginErrors.InvalidPasswordFormat -> TODO()
  is LoginErrors.InvalidUsername -> TODO()
}

fun handleGetUserError(error: GetUserErrors): String = when (error) {
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
  is GetUserErrors.InvalidUserId -> TODO()
  is GetUserErrors.UserNotFound -> TODO()
}

fun handleCommonError(error: CommonErrors): String = when (error) {
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
}
```

And we've effectively flattened the error hierarchy for all the cases üéâ

Given a class or object can implement as many interfaces as we want, it is also possible of going the other way around and implementing the multiple interfaces per case, which has the same effect even though a bit dirtier.

```kotlin
sealed interface CommonErrors
object ServerError : CommonErrors, GetUserErrors, LoginErrors
object Forbidden : CommonErrors, GetUserErrors, LoginErrors
object Unauthorized : CommonErrors, GetUserErrors, LoginErrors

sealed interface GetUserErrors
data class UserNotFound(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors
data class InvalidUserId(val userId: String) : GetUserErrors

sealed interface LoginErrors
data class InvalidUsername(val username: String) : LoginErrors
object InvalidPasswordFormat : LoginErrors

fun handleError(error: LoginErrors): String = when (error) {
  is InvalidUsername -> TODO()
  InvalidPasswordFormat -> TODO()
  ServerError -> TODO()
  Forbidden -> TODO()
  Unauthorized -> TODO()
}
```

This approach requires each implementation to declare the hierarchies it implements, so it can become dirty in cases where we have an error that needs to be part of lots of hierarchies, but it is coherent with how sealed classes work. I'd say this approach is handy when we need to make a single case part of multiple hierarchies and not do the same for all the cases on a complete sealed class.

For deeper reasoning about why to introduce the concept of sealed interfaces in the language you can read [the original proposal](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/sealed-interface-freedom.md).

### How to try it üëá

You can pick `1.5` as the language version in your `kotlinOptions` block. Keep in mind these features are experimental üôè

```groovy
tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> { // In Groovy: compileKotlin {
    kotlinOptions {
        languageVersion = "1.5"
        apiVersion = "1.5"
    }
}
```
