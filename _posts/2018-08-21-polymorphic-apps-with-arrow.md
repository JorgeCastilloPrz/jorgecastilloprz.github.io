Typeclasses are all about polymorphism. Achieving it at a program level provides much benefits, but it’s an abstract concept that probably requires a step by step explanation.

Lately I’ve found some people willing to understand. It’s mostly people that is not very familiarized with Functional Programming yet, so I decided to write a tutorial in the most simplistic way to provide gradual learning.

It started as a Medium post, then I deleted it and [ported it to Arrow docs patterns section](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/patterns/polymorphic_programs/), since that’s probably where it belongs and where it will provide more value.

I hope [these new docs](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/patterns/polymorphic_programs/) are useful enough. One of the main goals we have in [the Arrow team](https://arrow-kt.io/) and [47 Degrees](https://www.47deg.com/) is to flat the learning curve as much as possible by providing useful step by step docs based on example. So all the feedback will be super useful for us.

Thanks to [pacoworks](https://twitter.com/pacoworks), [Hadi Hariri](https://twitter.com/hhariri) and [Raúl Raja](https://twitter.com/raulraja) for their useful reviews and feedback.

Remember that if you’re interested on Functional Programming, Arrow, Kotlin, Android development or anything related, don’t hesitate to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JorgeCastilloPr), where I share a lot of ideas about it.

Of course, there’s also the official [arrow-kt](https://arrow-kt.io) account, where the Arrow team makes all the announcements.
