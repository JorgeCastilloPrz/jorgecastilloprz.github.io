This is the look and feel of an empty Android project right after creation üëç

> Colors depend on the theme picked on installation. There is light and dark. You can change that in settings.

On the right, you see the editor panel. This is where we code, still empty. On the left, the project structure. It is defaulted to the "Android" view (dropdown on the top edge), which groups files by type. To be honest, I don't find that view very useful, so I recommend switching to the "Project" one üëá

That will give us a really good perspective of the Android project structure.

The build tool used for Android projects is [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). We will learn about how to use it for Android during the course. It will allow us to build the project.

#### .gradle

Automatically generated when creating or importing a Gradle project. Maintains the build cache and information about the latest builds, so further ones can be faster.

#### .idea

Information about the project structure so Android Studio and its tools can understand it. Things like code highlighting, code formatting, autocomplete suggestions, and many more are possible thanks to this folder. Also generated.

#### app

The only **Gradle module** our project has for now. Gradle projects can be composed of multiple modules, so we can organize our code in multiple libraries and connect them together. Each module is like a self contained Gradle project that can be referenced from other modules.

The `app` module contains all the code and assets for our Android app. We will dive into it in the upcoming pills.

#### gradle

Contains the Gradle wrapper. It's an **embed lightweight instance of Gradle** so we can build the project without requiring a Gradle installation in our machine.

#### .gitignore

The ignore file for [Git](https://git-scm.com/). We can add the files and folders we don't want to be tracked by the VCS -- *Version Control System* --. Often generated files or local stuff that varies on every machine.

Android Studio will fill it with the usual files and directories to be ignored for the average Android Project. Leave it as is for now.

### build.gradle

The Gradle build configuration script for the project. Usually known as the "root" `build.gradle`, since there is also one per Gradle module. We are going over all of them in the upcoming pills, they are very important.

### gradle.properties

This is a key-value file where we can insert some properties that Gradle will read when building the project. Things like JVM arguments, library configuration flags, code style flags or similar things can usually be found here.

### gradlew and gradlew.bat

Scripts to run the Gradle wrapper. That's autogenerated and we'll not touch them neither run them manually. Android Studio will do that for us.

### local.properties

Same than `gradle.properties` but meant for local variables only relevant for you, like the path to the Android SDK on your machine. This file is ignored in the `.gitignore` since it includes variables other devs don't care about.

### settings.gradle

Gives Gradle information about the overall project structure and configuration. It lists the Gradle modules to include on the build and can contain some information like the project name.

### External libraries

This folder is automatically filled with the JARs and AARs (Android libraries) for all the libraries our project uses.
